Employee Management System
Overview
This is a simple, browser-based Employee Management System designed to provide quick access to employee data and perform basic operations. It offers a clean and intuitive user interface to interact with a set of pre-defined employee records.

This project is an implementation created by the Skills Network, as part of the IBM Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript course.

Features
The system provides the following key functionalities, accessible via the main dashboard:

Display Employees: View a list of all employees within the system. This shows their basic information, such as name, ID, and department.

Calculate Total Salaries: Get a real-time calculation of the total salaries for all employees in the database.

Display HR Employees: Filter the employee list to show only those who are part of the Human Resources (HR) department.

Find Employee by ID: Quickly search for and display the details of a specific employee by using their unique ID. In the current implementation, this is set to find an employee with ID 2.

How to Use
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The dashboard with all the available functions will be immediately visible. Click on any of the buttons to perform the desired action.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure and layout of the web page.

CSS: For styling the user interface, including button aesthetics and page layout.
